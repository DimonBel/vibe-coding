      "description": "Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Wednesday dismissed President Trump\u2019s threats and rejected his call for an \u201cunconditional surrender,\u201d adding to fears of a wider conflagration in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cIntelligent people who know Iran, the nation and the history of Iran will never speak to this nation in the language of threats, because the Iranian nation cannot be surrendered,\u201d he said in a televised statement, according to Iranian state media. \u201cThe Americans should know that any U.S. military intervention will undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage.\u201d\n\nHis remarks on the sixth day of the war were a defiant response to Israel and to President Trump, who has suggested that the United States could join Israel\u2019s bombing campaign against Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nAny potential U.S. military strike would likely have a much more devastating impact on Iran\u2019s nuclear program than Israel can wreak alone, and Israel has been pressing for the U.S. military to assist its efforts.\n\nMr. Trump has long maintained that he opposes getting involved in foreign wars and expressed hopes for a nuclear deal with Iran. But he said on Tuesday that \u201cour patience is wearing thin.\u201d\n\nIsrael continued to pummel Iran in the early hours of Wednesday. More than 50 Israeli warplanes attacked targets across the Iranian capital, according to the Israeli military, which said that a nuclear centrifuge plant was among the targets. The Iranian authorities did not immediately comment on the claims, though the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog said it had information suggesting that two centrifuge production facilities had been hit.\n\nIran fired about 30 ballistic missiles at Israel in two barrages after midnight and two waves of drones on Wednesday morning, but most of the missiles and all the drones were intercepted, Israel said. There were no immediate reports of casualties, and Iran\u2019s missile salvos appeared to be limited compared with earlier attacks.\n\nAs the Trump administration contemplates its next steps, the U.S. president seemed to suggest that the United States could enter the conflict against Iran. He used the word \u201cwe\u201d while referring to Israeli military operations, and also cited the possibility of killing Ayatollah Khamenei. \u201cWe are not going to take him out (kill!), at least for now,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nIsrael considers Iran\u2019s nuclear program to be a threat to its survival. The Israeli military has struck and damaged some of Iran\u2019s major nuclear sites since it started attacking the country on Friday, but lacks the capability to effectively hit the facilities at Fordo, the most important nuclear site, which lie deep underground. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel wants the United States to drop its biggest bunker-busting bombs on Fordo. Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu spoke on the phone on Tuesday, according to a Trump administration official who did not provide details.",
